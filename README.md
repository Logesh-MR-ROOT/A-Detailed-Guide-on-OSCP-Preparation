# A-Detailed-Guide-on-OSCP-Preparation
The Journey to Try Harder: 
                  For the past years of my life I had one goal: Pass OSCP on my first try. This guide contains those resources and my advice to prepare for your adventure to take the PWK/OSCP!
                  
                  From the syllabus I will breakdown each section by providing you the resources I used to prepare for the course. Once I finish going through the syllabus, I will also be providing some extra resources that came in handy. You don’t need to use this guide in order; feel free to jump around as it suits you.

 A quick intro on buffer overflow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo

What is Buffer Overflow?  (very clearly explained). After watching this video, you will get an idea on the concept behind buffer overflow. Also, will increase your urge on learning buffer overflow.

Don’t get bored after seeing Assembly language. Just go through the first 2 videos in this video series. That is enough for understanding the memory layout.

 Buffer Overflow Megaprimer by Vivek Ramachandran. http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=4.

In-depth video of buffer overflow where its explained in a very detailed way.

Some Valuable Resources           

These are some valuable resources which I found very useful in my OSCP Preparation. Many of them are now permanent reference resources even after I have cleared my OSCP.

Exploiting a machine is a Systematic Process:

1)Find the open ports and services running on ports
2)Enumerate the services and the machine
3)Exploit the correct vulnerability and gain access
4)Do proper post exploitation enumeration
5)Privilege Escalation

The VMs in the above link will be like OSCP labs. You can start solving these VMs. For the vulnhub VMs, there are walkthroughs for each machine. You can try each machine first by yourself. Else read the walkthrough, understand it, and then try to implement the method again in the VMs.

Also, try this https://www.hackthebox.gr/


Try to pwn as many machines as you can. Again, TRY HAAAAARDER.
